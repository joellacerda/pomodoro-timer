# Pomodoro Timer

This program is a Pomodoro Timer that allows users to set a timer for a specific amount of time, with a session length and a break length. 
The user can adjust the session and break lengths using increment and decrement buttons. The program is built using React and JavaScript. 
It also features a start/stop button and a reset button. When the timer runs out, an audio beep sound is played, and the program automatically
switches between session and break time. The program is built using a frontend framework such as React and JavaScript. It fulfills a set of 
user stories that include displaying the current calculation in a specific HTML element, centering the layout, and using a clean and 
minimalist design with a math-inspired background. This project was bootstrapped with  [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).
